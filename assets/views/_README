This directory contains templ components that represent entire pages. These components are composed of layout elements and page-specific content.

## Usage

To use these components, import them using the path:

```go
import "codeberg.org/pixivfe/pixivfe/v3/assets/views"
```

These components are called by route handlers to render a full HTML response. For an idiomatic usage example, see server/routes/about.go.
